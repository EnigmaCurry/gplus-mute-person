Mute Person on Google+
======================

This is a chrome extension that will hide users from your Google+
stream that are too noisy. 

Google+ let's you block a person, but that removes them from your
circles, which isn't always what you want. Sometimes you want to keep
in touch with people but don't want to see every single thing they do
show up in your stream. 

Once this extension is installed, add your noisy friends to a new
circle called "Muted" and they will no longer show up in your main
stream. You can still interact with them individually as well as see
them in any other circles you've defined.

Whenever you modify your "Muted" circle, make sure you refresh the
page to see the changes.

You can also install this extension from the [Chrome Store](http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jgehijcjdpcafmkdfgegcnlgfhofppak)
